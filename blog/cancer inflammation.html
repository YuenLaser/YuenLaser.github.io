            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>In the last 15 years, the leading cause of death in Canada is cancer. Since 1950’s billions of dollars have been poured into cancer researches and various treatment methods, yet millions of Canadians still die of this disease over the years.<br><br>For a long time the focus of managing cancer was to find a way to cure it, as it turned out, a cure is not that easy to find and soon the focus was also shifted to prevention. Ever since that time, researchers have been looking at many possible sources and substances that can lead to cancer formation. This is done with the hope to prevent cancer by avoiding the ingestion or contact with food or substances that are carcinogenic or cancer causing. This idea is a good one but the drawback is that there are too many substances that can be cancer causing and there are possibly many more that we have yet to find out. Therefore, it will be a long time before we can rely on this approach to control the rate of cancer deaths.<br><br>For some time now, scientists have known that chronic unchecked inflammation in our body could eventually lead to cancer. For example, chronic Irritable Bowel Syndrome could lead to colorectal cancer, chronic gastritis might turn to stomach or liver cancer, Reflux esophagitis could lead to esophageal cancer, gall bladder inflammation or cholecystitis may develop into gall bladder cancer, chronic bronchitis could risk ending up in lung cancer.<br><br>The link between inflammation and cancer is further confirmed by a research report that came out of the University of British Columbia in October 2008 where it was found that the risk of breast cancer is reduced by 12% in women who have been taking anti-inflammatory medications regularly. The author however pointed out that in taking anti-inflammatory drugs over a period of time, the patients risk developing gastric bleeding, kidney damages, liver problems, stroke and even heart attack. Clearly the drug approach is not a viable option. Other way to control and eliminate inflammation is needed to prevent the development of inflammation into possible cancer.<br><br>Clinically all types of inflammation is harmful to our body and should be gotten rid of as soon as possible. Inflammation interferes with our immune system and keeps us sick for a long time, it also interrupts with normal healing process and injury ceases to recovery. Recently, clinical studies have also pointed out the fact that inflammation has profound effects on hormones and glands that control our bodily functions. Chronic inflammation can also lead to harmful cells and tissue mutation that could lead to the development of cancer cells.<br><br>Many conditions can lead to inflammation. Some of the most common causes of inflammation are as a result of injuries, allergies, infections, auto immune diseases and degenerative arthritis. It is imperative to eliminate inflammation from these sources as soon as possible in order to prevent possible cancer formation in our bodies.<br><br>Low Intensity Laser Therapy have been shown to be extremely effective in getting rid of inflammation in our bodies and allows the body to heal naturally without having to take any medications that can cause us more harm than good. There is no harmful side effect with Laser Therapy and patients of all ages can benefit from the treatment.<br><br>Controlling inflammation not only relieves pain and suffering, it can also help to keep us healthy and reduces the risk of developing cancer.</p></div>
